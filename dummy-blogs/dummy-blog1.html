    While I started with this project I found little difficult to develop logic to build this plan. Then it became
    easier
    for me when
    I decided I should break it into parts and should try to develop it by breaking it into various parts. So I first
    developed <b>input</b> for entering todo and a <b>button</b> for adding todo. Then made all the lists using
    <b>ul</b> tag and put <b>li</b> tag in
    it and put all the items on the list I wanted. Then imported <b>useState</b> from <b>react</b> and made an
    <b>useState</b> function.
    Then made an array of inputs and todos. Then the plan was to make an add button to make an option to add items by
    the user. so I made an add button to make it run I made a function <b>addTodo</b> which contained an array of input
    that
    the user will enter and...todos which will bring all the list of todos.
    Also added edit button so the user can also edit the items in the list.

  </p>
  <p>

    Then I made <b>showTodo</b> function that renders all elements with add and edit button. On clicking the edit
    button, <b>editButton</b> function will run.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then for the deletion of tasks user might also need a deleting feature so added a del button. For implementing this
    I made <b>delTodos</b> function with filter method in it.

  </p>
  <p> Then made a function <b>handleInputChange</b> so that if a user puts any changes in the input it should get saved. 
  To prevent addition of todos with empty title, I added an if condition that checks if the
    input is not equal to an empty string then only the further code should run.
  </p>
  <p>Then in the <b>editTodo</b> function if the user is not changing any name keeping it empty it should not change
    anything
    so for that I added an if condition that if the input is not equal to null then only the further process the map
    method.</p>
